# CBRU Exchange Club demonstration
25.9.2018 demonstration of using R (and JASP) for an informal seminar

We'll be going through some basics with R, simulating a real-like dataset and doing some statistical analyses like regression analysis. ANOVA materials will be finished at a later date.

THIS IS NOT A DATA ANALYSIS GUIDE! Some things are done to make the demonstration more convenient or to show what can be done in R. The focus is not on properly using any of the particular methods. When running analyses and making inferences, you should first know what you want to do. After that, selected parts of the R code provided here might be helpful for seeing how you tell R to do what you want it to do.
